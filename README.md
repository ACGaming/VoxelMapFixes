# VoxelMap Fixes

VoxelMap Fixes patches several methods of VoxelMap to bring it in line with modded environments.
The following aspects are changed:

* Performance optimizations (more memory-friendly texture lookup)
* Enhanced compatibility for modded environments (safer fetching of tile entities)
* Configurable blacklisted tile entities and blocks (until version 1.0.6)
* Mod support for [Tomb Many Graves 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tomb-many-graves-2)

Requires [VoxelMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/voxelmap) and [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter).
